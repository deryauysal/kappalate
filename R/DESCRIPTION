Version: 1.0.0
Author: Related to "Abadie's Kappa and Weighting Estimators of the Local Average Treatment Effect" by Tymon Słoczyński, Derya Uysal, & Jeffrey M. Wooldridge

Description: Estimates the local average treatment effect (LATE) using methods based on inverse probability weighting, most of which can be motivated by Abadie's (2003) kappa theorem. See Słoczyński, Uysal, and Wooldridge (2024) for a detailed treatment of the underlying theoretical results.
