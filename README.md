# Stata
It contains the Stata package to estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE) using Abadie's kappa approach and other weighting estimators (with Tymon Słoczyński and Jeffrey M. Wooldridge). To download from SSC, type “ssc install kappalate” in Stata.

# R
It contains the R package to estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE) using Abadie's kappa approach and other weighting estimators (with Tymon Słoczyński and Jeffrey M. Wooldridge).

> **Status:** The R code is currently in **beta** and has **not been extensively tested**. Interfaces and results may change. Feedback, bug reports, and pull requests are very welcome.

# Gauss
It contains Gauss codes for the simulation part of the paper.
